The Original Unedited Gentoo Install Script I Created May, 2014

# Disclaimer

Yes this code is probably really really old, depreciated, broken, ugly, and has bad syntax but cut me a break. I was learning when I wrote this.
Maybe it's not. Honestly, I haven't got the time to review it. Love it, hate it. I don't really care but thanks for stopping by to check it out. 
I hope you find happiness and love in life wherever it takes you.

# About This: The Short Version

Basically I created this script by smashing together my own ideas with some code I found on some wiki page.

# About This: The Long Version

Sometime in May of 2014 I was in a very hyperactive and eager state to learn about Linux and other operating systems.
I had lots of spare hardware and time to learn about these new and different operating systems like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Linux.
I had already learned about more user friendly distributions of Linux like Ubuntu but I seeked a more in depth look at the system.
Gentoo suited this need very well so I spent weeks learning how to install a complete Linux environment from almost scratch. 
Well after learning how to complete an install manually I needed a way to streamline the process for Virtualization. 
So I learned about Xen and even bought server grade hardware to run it on. Now I needed some cool custom operating system to run on it right.
I created this Gentoo install script from some code I found on a wiki page in 2014.
I used it for a while to speed up my installs of Gentoo on that Xen server. It was a great tool for me to learn about Linux and bash scripting.
I recently fired up one of my old Macbooks and found this half baked script in the documents folder. I got all nostalgic and decided to post it here.
Thats pretty much it. Not a great story but a true one. Thanks for reading and checking out this page. I hope you got something from it.
