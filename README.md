The Original Unedited Gentoo Install Script I Created May, 2014

# Disclaimer

Yes this code is probably really really old, depreciated, broken, ugly, and has bad syntax but cut me a break. I was learning when I wrote this.
Maybe it's not. Honestly, I haven't got the time to review it. Love it, hate it. I don't really care but thanks for stopping by to check it out. 
I hope you find happiness and love in life wherever it takes you.

# About This: The Short Version

Basically I created this script by smashing together my own ideas with some code I found on some wiki page.
